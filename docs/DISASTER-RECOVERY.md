# Disaster Recovery Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the APGI system. Disaster recovery encompasses procedures for recovering from catastrophic failures, data loss, system-wide outages, and other major incidents that threaten system availability and data integrity.

## Disaster Classification

### Level 1: Minor Incident

- Single component failure
- Temporary service degradation
- Data inconsistency in non-critical components

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 1 hour
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 15 minutes

### Level 2: Major Incident

- Multiple component failures
- Partial system outage
- Significant data loss in secondary systems

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 hour

### Level 3: Critical Disaster

- Complete system failure
- Total data center outage
- Widespread data corruption

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 24 hours
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 4 hours

### Level 4: Catastrophic Disaster

- Permanent loss of primary data center
- Complete destruction of infrastructure
- Loss of critical personnel

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 72 hours
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 24 hours

## Recovery Preparation

### Backup Strategy

#### Primary Backup Systems

1. **Database Backups**
   - Full backups: Daily at 02:00 UTC
   - Incremental backups: Every 4 hours
   - Transaction log backups: Every 15 minutes
   - Retention: 30 days for incrementals, 1 year for full backups

2. **Configuration Backups**
   - System configuration: Every 6 hours
   - User configurations: Real-time with changes
   - Environment configurations: Daily

3. **Code and Artifact Backups**
   - Source code: Continuous via Git
   - Docker images: Registry with immutable tags
   - Dependencies: Cached and version-pinned

#### Backup Storage Locations

```yaml
backup_locations:
  primary:
    type: cloud_storage
    provider: aws_s3
    bucket: apgi-production-backups
    region: us-west-2
    encryption: aes256

  secondary:
    type: cloud_storage
    provider: gcp_cloud_storage
    bucket: apgi-backup-secondary
    region: us-central1
    encryption: aes256

  tertiary:
    type: on_premises
    location: secure_facility
    encryption: hardware_security_module
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Automated Recovery Scripts

#### System Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# system_health_check.sh

echo "=== APGI System Health Check ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date -u)"

# Check core services
services=("apgi-api" "apgi-worker" "redis" "postgresql" "nginx")
failed_services=()

for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    if ! systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; then
        echo "❌ Service $service is not running"
        failed_services+=("$service")
    else
        echo "✅ Service $service is running"
    fi
done

# Check database connectivity
if ! pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "❌ Database is not accessible"

fi

# Check memory usage
memory_usage=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{printf "%.0f", $3/$2 * 100.0}')
if [ "$memory_usage" -gt 95 ]; then
    echo "❌ Memory usage is ${memory_usage}% (>95%)"
    failed_services+=("memory")

if [ ${#failed_services[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "🎉 All systems operational"
    exit 0
else
    echo "⚠️  Issues detected with: ${failed_services[*]}"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Automated Recovery Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# automated_recovery.sh

echo "=== APGI Automated Recovery ==="
echo "Started at: $(date -u)"

# Load environment variables
source /etc/apgi/environment

# Step 1: Stop all services gracefully
echo "Stopping services..."
for service in "${SERVICES[@]}"; do
    systemctl stop "$service"
    sleep 5
done

# Step 2: Verify database integrity
echo "Checking database integrity..."
if ! pg_checksums --check "$PGDATA"; then
    echo "Database integrity check failed, attempting repair..."
    # Attempt database repair
    systemctl stop postgresql
    pg_resetwal "$PGDATA"
    systemctl start postgresql
fi

# Step 3: Restore from latest backup if needed
if [ "$DATABASE_CORRUPTION_DETECTED" = "true" ]; then
    echo "Restoring database from backup..."
    LATEST_BACKUP=$(find /backups/database -name "*.sql.gz" -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -n | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)

    if [ -n "$LATEST_BACKUP" ]; then
        gunzip < "$LATEST_BACKUP" | psql -U apgi -d apgi_production
        echo "Database restored from $LATEST_BACKUP"
    else
        echo "ERROR: No database backup found!"
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# Step 4: Restart services in dependency order
echo "Restarting services..."
declare -a service_order=("postgresql" "redis" "apgi-worker" "apgi-api" "nginx")

for service in "${service_order[@]}"; do
    echo "Starting $service..."
    systemctl start "$service"

    # Wait for service to be healthy
    timeout=60
    while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
        if systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; then
            echo "✅ $service started successfully"
            break
        fi
        sleep 5
        timeout=$((timeout - 5))
    done

    if [ $timeout -le 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ Failed to start $service"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Step 5: Run health checks
echo "Running health checks..."
if ./system_health_check.sh; then
    echo "🎉 Recovery completed successfully"
    exit 0
else
    echo "❌ Health checks failed after recovery"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Manual Recovery Procedures

#### Procedure 1: Service Restart Recovery

**Trigger**: Individual service failures

**Steps**:

1. Identify failed service using monitoring dashboard
2. Check service logs for error details
3. Attempt graceful service restart:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
   ```

4. If restart fails, check dependencies and restart them first
5. Verify service health and connectivity
6. Update incident ticket with resolution

#### Procedure 2: Database Recovery

**Trigger**: Database connectivity issues or corruption

**Steps**:

1. Check database server status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status postgresql
   ```

2. If server is down, restart it:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

3. Check database integrity:

   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres pg_checksums --check /var/lib/postgresql/data
   ```

4. If corruption detected, restore from backup:

   ```bash
   # Stop dependent services
   sudo systemctl stop apgi-api apgi-worker

   # Restore from backup
   sudo -u postgres psql -d apgi_production < /backups/database/latest.sql

   # Restart services
   sudo systemctl start apgi-worker apgi-api
   ```

5. Verify data integrity and application functionality

#### Procedure 3: Full System Recovery

**Trigger**: Complete system failure

**Steps**:
1. Assess damage and determine recovery scope
2. Activate backup infrastructure (AWS/GCP)
3. Restore system from latest backups:
   - Deploy infrastructure using Terraform/IaC
   - Restore database from S3/GCS backups
   - Deploy application containers
   - Restore configuration files
4. Verify system functionality with comprehensive tests
5. Redirect traffic to recovered system
6. Decommission failed infrastructure

#### Procedure 4: Data Loss Recovery

**Trigger**: Significant data loss or corruption

**Steps**:
1. Stop all write operations to prevent further corruption
2. Identify extent of data loss using backup verification
3. Restore data from appropriate backup level:
   - Point-in-time recovery for recent losses
   - Full backup restoration for widespread corruption
4. Verify data consistency and referential integrity
5. Implement additional safeguards if needed
6. Resume normal operations with monitoring

### Cloud-Specific Recovery
