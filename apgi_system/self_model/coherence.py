"""Coherence maintenance between minimal and narrative self."""

from typing import Dict, Any


class CoherenceMaintenance:
    """
    Maintains coherence and unity between minimal and narrative self-models.

    Integrates the moment-to-moment minimal self with the long-term narrative
    self to maintain a unified sense of personal identity. This component
    ensures that immediate bodily self-awareness remains consistent with
    autobiographical self-knowledge.

    **Integration Functions**:
    - Monitors consistency between minimal and narrative self-representations
    - Detects conflicts between immediate experience and long-term identity
    - Maintains overall phenomenal unity of self-experience
    - Provides integrated coherence metrics for the complete self-model

    **Coherence Computation**:
    - Weighted combination: 60% minimal coherence + 40% narrative coherence
    - Reflects greater weight of immediate experience in moment-to-moment awareness
    - Phenomenal unity threshold: coherence > 0.7 indicates unified self-experience

    **Clinical Relevance**:
    - Low coherence may indicate dissociative states
    - Conflicts between minimal and narrative self can signal identity disturbances
    - Coherence tracking enables detection of self-related pathology

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : Dict[str, Any]
        Configuration dictionary (currently unused but maintained for consistency)

    Attributes
    ----------
    coherence_score : float
        Current overall coherence between minimal and narrative self (0-1)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> coherence = CoherenceMaintenance({})
    >>> minimal_info = {'coherence': 0.8, 'agency': 0.7}
    >>> narrative_info = {'narrative_coherence': 0.9, 'identity_strength': 0.6}
    >>> result = coherence.update(minimal_info, narrative_info)
    >>> print(f"Phenomenal unity: {result['phenomenal_unity']}")
    Phenomenal unity: True

        """
        Update coherence between minimal and narrative self-models.

        Computes integrated coherence by combining coherence measures from
        both minimal and narrative self-components. Uses weighted averaging
        to reflect the relative importance of immediate vs. long-term
        self-experience.

        Parameters
        ----------
